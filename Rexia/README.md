This is the front-end design of Rexia company based on html and css.

First of all pull the git image into your computer. 
The initial push consists of following html files:

1. Rexia (main home) 
2. Marketing
3. Signin 
4. Contact us

Make sure  to include all the libraries since they have a role in enhancing the UI.
Each html file has their own 'css' file and one generic file imported to all of them named as 'file.css' which contains the responsive layout of navbars and footers.
